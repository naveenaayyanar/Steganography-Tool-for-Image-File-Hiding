**Uses of HTML Code in Your Steganography Project**

1. **Structure of Web Pages**
   - HTML provides the basic structure for your web pages, allowing you to define elements like headings, paragraphs, forms, and buttons.

2. **User  Input Forms**
   - HTML forms are essential for user interaction. You will use forms to:
     - Allow users to upload images (e.g., `<input type="file">`).
     - Collect secret messages from users (e.g., `<textarea>` or `<input type="text">`).
     - Submit the data to the server for processing (e.g., using `<button type="submit">`).

3. **Navigation**
   - HTML can be used to create navigation menus or tabs that allow users to switch between different functionalities (e.g., encoding and decoding pages).

4. **Displaying Results**
   - After processing, HTML is used to display the results back to the user, such as showing the extracted message or providing a download link for the encoded image.

5. **Styling and Layout**
   - While CSS handles the visual presentation, HTML provides the structure that CSS styles. You can use HTML elements like `<div>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>` to organize content and layout.

6. **Embedding Multimedia**
   - If you want to include images, videos, or audio in your application (e.g., to demonstrate how the steganography works), HTML allows you to embed these elements easily.

7. **Accessibility**
   - HTML provides semantic elements (like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) that improve accessibility for users with disabilities, making your application more user-friendly.

8. **Integration with JavaScript**
   - HTML elements can be manipulated using JavaScript for dynamic interactions, such as showing/hiding elements, validating form inputs, or providing real-time feedback to users.

 **Example HTML Elements in Your Project**
- **Form for Encoding**:
  ```html
  <form action="/encode" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="file" name="image" accept=".png" required>
      <textarea name="message" placeholder="Enter your secret message"></textarea>
      <button type="submit">Hide Message</button>
  </form>
  ```

- **Form for Decoding**:
  ```html
  <form action="/decode" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="file" name="image" accept=".png" required>
      <button type="submit">Extract Message</button>
  </form>
  ```

- **Displaying Results**:
  ```html
  <div>
      <h2>Extracted Message:</h2>
      <p>{{ message }}</p>
  </div>
  ```

 **Conclusion**
HTML is fundamental to your steganography project as it provides the structure and elements necessary for user interaction, data submission, and displaying results.

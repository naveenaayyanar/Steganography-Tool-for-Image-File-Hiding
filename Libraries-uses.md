**Libraries and Their Uses**

1. **Pillow**
   - **Purpose**: Image processing library in Python.
   - **Usage**: 
     - To open, manipulate, and save image files.
     - To convert images to different formats (e.g., from PNG to RGB).
     - To access pixel data for encoding and decoding messages.

2. **NumPy**
   - **Purpose**: Library for numerical computations in Python.
   - **Usage**: 
     - To handle image data as arrays for efficient pixel manipulation.
     - To perform operations on pixel values (e.g., modifying the least significant bits).

3. **Flask**
   - **Purpose**: Web framework for building web applications in Python.
   - **Usage**: 
     - To create a web server that handles HTTP requests.
     - To manage routing for different pages (e.g., home, encode, decode).
     - To serve HTML templates and static files (CSS, JavaScript).

4. **os**
   - **Purpose**: Standard library for interacting with the operating system.
   - **Usage**: 
     - To handle file paths and manage file uploads.
     - To create directories for storing uploaded images and outputs.

5. **cryptography** (optional, if implementing encryption)
   - **Purpose**: Library for secure encryption and decryption.
   - **Usage**: 
     - To encrypt messages before embedding them in images.
     - To decrypt messages after extraction from images.

### **Summary of Library Functions**
- **Pillow**: Image opening, manipulation, and saving.
- **NumPy**: Array manipulation for pixel data.
- **Flask**: Web server setup, routing, and template rendering.
- **os**: File management and path handling.
- **cryptography**: (if used) Message encryption and decryption.

### **Installation Commands**
To install the necessary libraries, you would typically run:
```bash
pip install pillow numpy flask cryptography
```
